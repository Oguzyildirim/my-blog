As a first real blog post. I wanted to write about IO.

**I will cover following topics.**

― What are Blocking vs Non-Blocking

― Non Blocking I/O vs multi-threaded apps.

― Some example use cases(Maybe spring webflux or nodejs code snippets).

I know the importance of this topic and i am not going to rush it. Try to do as best as i can. Maybe i am going to publish part by part.
There are lots of topics on this topic so i would like to create my own examples of explaning and will try different techniques.

Have a good day.
